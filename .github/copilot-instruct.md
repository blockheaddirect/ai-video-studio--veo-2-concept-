# GitHub Copilot Instruct

## Purpose
This file serves as a guide for using GitHub Copilot effectively in this project. It outlines the project's structure, testing strategy, and development workflow.

## Project Structure
- **Frontend**: Located in the `client/` directory.
  - Contains React components, hooks, and contexts.
- **Backend**: Placeholder in the `backend/` directory.
  - Intended for server-side logic.
- **Shared**: Located in the `shared/` directory.
  - Contains reusable constants, types, and services.
- **Tests**: Consolidated in the `__TESTS__/tests/` directory.
  - Includes unit tests for various parts of the application.

## Testing Strategy
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
  - Write tests before implementing features.
  - Use red-green testing to validate functionality.
- **Test Files**:
  - Ensure all test files are located in `__TESTS__/tests/`.
  - Use Jest for unit testing.

## Development Workflow
1. **Plan**:
   - Define the feature or fix.
   - Write tests to validate the expected behavior.
2. **Implement**:
   - Develop the feature or fix.
   - Ensure code aligns with the project's structure and best practices.
3. **Test**:
   - Run tests to validate functionality.
   - Fix any failing tests.
4. **Refactor**:
   - Optimize code for readability and performance.
   - Ensure all tests pass after refactoring.

## Notes
- Use GitHub Copilot to assist with code generation and refactoring.
- Follow the project's structure and testing strategy to maintain consistency.
- Document any changes or additions in this file.

## Next Steps
- Complete the implementation of missing features.
- Ensure all tests pass.
- Optimize the project's structure and workflow.
